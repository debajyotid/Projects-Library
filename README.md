### Introduction
---

In this self paced collection of Repositories, you will find many projects related to Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Recommender Systems and Deep Learning that I have worked on so far. Throughout this guideline you will walk through the details of projects and repositories.

You may reach me whenever you want to get further information about projects.

### Tensorflow Keras Model Deployment
---

### Telecom Churn Classification using Spark
---

### Fashion MNIST Classification
---

### Bank Customer Churn Modelling using Neural Networks
---
This Kaggle project involves building an ANN-based churn model which can determine whether certain bank customers will continue using their service or not. The ANN model analyzes the relationship between customer churn & multiple independent variables affecting churn. Recommendations for improvements in service were suggested based on the results of the analysis.

#### Skills and Tools
Neural Networks, Classification, Keras, Tensorflow

### HR Analytics and classification using ANN
---

### ML Model Deployment
---

### Clustering cars based on attributes
---
Analyzed cars dataset and performed exploratory data analysis and then categorized them using K means clustering. Used linear regression on the different clusters and estimated coefficients.

#### Skills and Tools
K means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, EDA, Linear Regression

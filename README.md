### Model Interpretability

# Model-Interpretability

## Please Explain your Predictions?

Machine learning is in the center of the latest progress in technology and is an essential tool for accurate predictions nowadays. However, most of the time we neither can clearly identify nor explain the logic behind these predictions because the model is just too complex. In those cases our machine learning model is called a ’Black Box’.

So how do we know if we can trust this model? How should we be able to trust it, when we don’t even know how it actually makes it’s predictions?

These are important questions which occur when the challenges of Model explainability are presented, especially if it is used for decision making. Users need to be confident that the model will perform well. Gaining trust in predictions through increasing transparency of a black box model.

There are multiple python libraries for this task.
1. ELI5
2. LIME
3. SHAP

### Bank Customer Churn Modelling using Neural Networks
---
This Kaggle project involves building an ANN-based churn model which can determine whether certain bank customers will continue using their service or not. The ANN model analyzes the relationship between customer churn & multiple independent variables affecting churn. Recommendations for improvements in service were suggested based on the results of the analysis.

#### Skills and Tools
Neural Networks, Classification, Keras, Tensorflow

### Clustering cars based on attributes
---
Analyzed cars dataset and performed exploratory data analysis and then categorized them using K means clustering. Used linear regression on the different clusters and estimated coefficients.

#### Skills and Tools
K means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, EDA, Linear Regression
